                "team": "Music Production Team",
                "answer": "With elements such as tents, hot air balloons, and carousels showcased on the Firework Isles, it's easy to think of an amusement park! Naturally, carnival music featuring the accordion comes to mind. Since the accordion is the main instrument for the Florawish area, it was the perfect choice as the primary instrument for our music this time. However, pure carnival music would be a bit too overwhelming for the Firework Isles, so we incorporated bossa nova elements to highlight the laid-back, joyous holiday atmosphere during the day, and the romantic, ethereal ambiance of fireworks blooming under the stars at night.",

                "team": "Music Production/Sound Design Team",
                "answer": "Fireworks (extremely loud)! They're a spectacle that happens only at night~ As the highlight of the Firework Festival, their place in the music lineup is dominant. They won't be overshadowed by combat music, carriage rides, or anything elseâ€”once the fireworks begin, the music won't stop!!!",
